## LLD: Low Level Design
- Scalability: How can you scale your application as easily as possible?
- Maintainability: New features must be easy to integrate without losing existing features, and the code should be easy to debug.
- Reusability: Code should be highly reusable and not be tightly coupled.

## HLD vs LLD va DSA
- HLD (High Level Design): Focuses on system architecture, technology stack, database choices, server scaling, and cost optimization.
- LLD (Low Level Design): Focuses on code structure, class diagrams, and implementation details.
- DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms): Used to solve problems in LLD; DSA is the brain of the application, while LLD is the skeleton.

## Algorithm: Rider Mapping
Rider mapping algorithms are used to efficiently match riders with drivers in ride-sharing platforms. The main goals are to minimize wait times, optimize routes, and maximize resource utilization.

---

## Summary
- HLD focuses on system architecture.
- LLD focuses on code structure.
- DSA is used to solve problems in LLD.
